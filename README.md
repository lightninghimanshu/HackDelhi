NFT market-place for Video games

Problem: Online piracy

Online piracy seems to plague any and all video games these days. But, contrary to popular belief, the people who ‘crack’ the game, and remove the drm from these games don’t seen to do it because of the prices. 

They do it because of ‘untrustworthy drm’. 

In short, whenever you buy a game, you essentially rent it from the publishing company. Meaning they have the means and the right to revoke your access to their games.   

Modern DRMs like denude also comes with a huge performance overhead, causing the game to lag even on a decently specked PC.

Solution: Make video games a NFT

This will eliminate the need for DRMs as we would just have to check on the blockchain whether I own the game or not.

The blockchain is immutable, hence the publishing company cannot take away my game at their will

Better performance, as no complicated DRM software is running.

The added ability to resell your owned games like physical copies
